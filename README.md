# NYT-Word-Project

Using New York Times API, Streamlit, nltk and Python and JSON files, I constructed an application that modified data retrieved from the API. 

Specifically, users are able to manipulate data gathered through 2 different API's, Top Stories and Most Popular Articles.

Within the Top Stories API, users can select the topic of interest as well as select the colors and number of words used in the Wordcloud. Additionaly, users can use a frequency distribution chart to display the most common words within the selected topic of interest.

Within the Most Popular Articles API, users can not only do the same actions as the previous API, but can now also select a time frame alone with how the popular article was shared.

## Opening the application:

Download the branch and import all proper libraries.

Make sure you are in Python 3.10 or earlier as 3.11 would not work at the time of writing the application
